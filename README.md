# Calculating-Area-of-a-Room-s-Interior
A simple program to demonstrate input, computation, and output using several variables.


# Problem: 
- Using python, write a program to input the length, width, and height of a rectangular room, all in feet.
- Using this information and the nominal coverage for a given paint, compute the amount of paint needed to cover the four walls and ceiling, assuming no doors or windows.
- Output the whole number of gallons of paint needed. 
- Also, compute and output the number of 4”x4” floor tiles need to cover the floor of the room. 
- Assume one gallon of paint will cover 400 square feet, and that the tiles cover 4”x4” neglecting any gaps.
- Accept input from the user on the dimensions (length, width, and height) of a room in feet.
- Compute and print the amount of paint needed to cover the four walls and ceiling, assuming no doors or windows.
- Compute and output the number of 4”x4” floor tiles need to cover the floor of the room. 
# Example:
- Assume a room of length 10 feet, width 12 feet and height 8 feet. 
- The area of the walls would be:10 ft x 8 ft = 80 sq. ft. (2 walls this size) 12 ft x 8 ft = 96 sq. ft. (2 walls this size) 
- The area of the ceiling would be:10 ft x 12 ft = 120 sq. ft. 
- The total area would then be:2 x 80 sq ft. + 2 x 96 sq. ft. + 120 sq. ft = 472 sq. ft. 
- 472 sq. ft / 400 sq. ft per gallon = 1.18 gallons thus 2 gallons
- Given the size of the tiles, it is necessary to use nine (9) tiles to cover one square foot of the floor.
- The area of the floor would be: 10 ft x 12 ft = 120 sq. ft. 
- This would require:9 tiles per sq. ft * 120 sq. ft. = 1080 tiles. 
# Sample Output:
- Enter the length of the room in feet: 10 
- Enter the width of the room in feet: 12 
- Enter the height of the room in feet: 8 
- The total paint needed to cover the walls and ceiling is 2 gallons. 
- The total number of tiles to cover the floor is 1080.
